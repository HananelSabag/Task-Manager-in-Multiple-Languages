# Task Manager in Multiple Languages

### Author: **Hananel Sabag**

## Overview
This repository showcases the implementation of a **Task Manager** application across multiple programming languages. The project is designed to demonstrate:
- Versatility in adapting the same problem to different programming paradigms.
- A comparative approach to evaluate the strengths and capabilities of each language.
- Practical programming skills in Python, Java, C++, and more.

Each language implementation is structured within its own directory, with a focus on clarity, modularity, and maintainability.

---

## Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- **`Python/`**: Implementation of the Task Manager in Python.  
- **`Java/`**: Implementation of the Task Manager in Java.  
- **`C++/`**: Implementation of the Task Manager in C++.  

Each directory contains:
1. **Source Code**: The main implementation files.
2. **README.md**: A detailed explanation of the implementation in that specific language.
3. Additional supporting files as necessary (e.g., configuration, examples).

---

## Features
- **Task Creation and Management**: Add, edit, and delete tasks.
- **Status Tracking**: Mark tasks as "completed" or "pending."
- **Persistence**: Save and retrieve tasks (to be implemented in some languages with file or database support).
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simplified CLI (Command-Line Interface) or GUI depending on the language.

## Objectives
1. To display proficiency in multiple programming languages.
2. To highlight differences in syntax, structure, and paradigms between languages.
3. To showcase adaptability and problem-solving skills.

---

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HananelSabag/Task-Manager-in-Multiple-Languages.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the language-specific directory, e.g., `Python/`.
3. Follow the instructions in the `README.md` file of the specific directory to run the program.

## Future Enhancements
- Add SQL integration for database-backed persistence.
- Extend the program to include task scheduling and reminders.
- Provide cross-platform compatibility and GUI support.
